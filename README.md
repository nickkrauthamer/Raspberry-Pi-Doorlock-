# Raspberry-Pi-Doorlock-
Our group's initial decision for our project was to make a voice controlled LED light bulb, and then move onto making a voice controlled light bulb that could be installed in somenone's house. However we ran into a problem after downloading the voice command pgoram called Steven Hickson, which caused us to scrap the project completely. We then decided to make a remotely controlled door lock using the smartphone app Blynk, our Raspberry Pi, and a servo motor. We also added a security camera that would take a picture of someone passing by the camera and send it as an e-mail. We decided to switch to these two projects because we wanted to stay in the same realm of home automation, but could not use voice recognition because of the errors in the program. The way our project works is that the Blynk app acts as a remote control, and by presseing a button on the app, it sends a message to the Raspberry Pi to turn on the servo motor, which then turns the lock, unlocking or locking the door.
