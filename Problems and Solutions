1) Problem - Sending IP address upon boot of Raspberry Pi
   Solution - A dealy at boot was needed because the ip address was not reveived at boot and the e-mail was not sending.
2) Problem - Had to install Git-client before installing Github libraries
   Solution - Installed Git-client then Github libraries
3) Problem - Audio settings had to be set at every reboot
   Solution - Had to tweak audio settings to automatically enable the audio capabilities at boot
4) Problem - The default audio output was through the HDMI
   Solution - Had to reroute the audio settings to use the 3.5mm audio output
5) Problem - Test records and playbacks were working but did not work with the Steven Hickson Voice Reccognition software
   Solution - The issue was that the google coice recognition software does not allow multi-channel mic inputs. The settings needed to be tweaked to only allow mono input
6) Problem - The config file of the cice command was not connecting with the WiringPi
   Solution - A line with the WiringPi Directory needed to be added
7) Problem - Changes in the alleged conifg files were not shown
   Solution - There was a seperate MakeFile that was in the install directory
8) Problem - Steven Hickson Vociec Recognition Software was not working
   Solution - Scrapped project and moved onto remote controlled lock project
9) Problem - Ran into issues with nmp (Node Package Manager) because we were using the lite version of Raspian Jessie
   Solution - Installed NPM through alternate methods
10) Problem - After installing motion, the default settings were not working
    Solution - Changed the config file as following
    DAEMON = ON
    Webcam_localhost = OFF
    IPV6_ON
    Webcontrol_localhost = OFF
    output_pictures off
    ffmpeg output_movies off
